# AntDance

This project is mainly about animating computer graphics by using data from motion capture systems. The data I used in this project come from the Carnegie Mellon motion capture database(http:// mocap.cs.cmu.edu). The main program will have one single ant dancing in a specific setting. There will be five buttons to control the antâ€™s movement and choosing each of them will let the ant dance in another move.
